## Requirements
You must be running newest version of android studio (Chipmunk). This project will not run if you are using legacy versions (Bumblebee or older).
You need to have a device that is running android 11 or newer.

When requested, you must allow for location services to play multiplayer. Otherwise multiplayer functionality will not work. 

Multiplayer functionality will not work in Android Studio's emulators, as the way the network is configured does not allow for communication between multiple emulated detices.
