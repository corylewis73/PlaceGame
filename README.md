## Requirements
+You must be running the newest version of android studio (Chipmunk). This project will not run if you are using legacy versions (Bumblebee or older).

+You need to have a device that is running android 11 or newer.

+When requested, you must allow location services to play multiplayer. Otherwise multiplayer functionality will not work. 

+Multiplayer functionality will not work in Android Studio's emulators, as the way the network is configured does not allow for communication between multiple emulated devices. The app has been tested on two phones running Android 11: older versions of android may work but it is not guaranteed. The code also requires a minimum SDK level of 9, but that should be fulfilled by having a phone that runs Android 11.
